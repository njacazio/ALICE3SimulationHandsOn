## Scope of the session
- Learn what FAT does 10 min
- Build you own detector layout, learn how to extract momentum resolution from FAT and compare to the ACTS output 20 min
- Learn how to produce LUTs 15 min

## At the end:
- the analysers should be able to produce a given detector geometry, assess its performance and produce the LUTs to be plugged into the FastSimulation

## Assignment:
- preparing a detector layout
- producing LUTs 
- plotting them
