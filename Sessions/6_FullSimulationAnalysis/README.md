## Scope of the session
- Learn how to read the information of the hits
- Learn how to draw the detector geometry
- Extract some particle level information between the hits and the corresponding particle
- Do some more advanced studies

## At the end:
- At the end the analyser should be able to run a full analysis and extract a physics perforamnce statement on the detector configuration used as input

## Assignment
- produce a hit map of the TRK detector
- produce a hit map of the TF3 detector
- link hits to particles and select hits from electrons only, check electrons produced from conversions
- plot the digit map
