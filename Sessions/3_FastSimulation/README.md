## Scope of the session
- Learn what the on the fly simulation does for primary tracks and decays, integration with hyperloop 15 min
- Few details about the event generators in general (e.g. pythia) configuration and O2DPG 5 min
- Use case 1: efficiency and momentum resolution of pion kaons and protons **with multiple detectors** 20 min
- Put the LUTs on the CCDB and retrieval and run with your own detector configuration, start producing D0 events 15 min
- Use case 2: weak decay reconstruction performance with the TEnv configuration 20 min

## At the end:
- the analyser should be able to run the (staged) monte carlo simulation with different detector configurations and analyse the output to extract detector performance metrics (efficiency, resolution et cetera)
