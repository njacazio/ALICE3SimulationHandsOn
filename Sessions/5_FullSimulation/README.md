## Session 75 min

## Scope of the session
- What is full simulation
- What is geometry
- What is the current status of the full simulation in O2
- Running you own full simuation within the O2

## At the end:
- At the end the analyser should be able to run a full analysis and extract a physics perforamnce statement on the detector configuration used as input

## Assignment
- plot the simple geometry and experience with the segmentation. Add some layers. 
- run the simulation with pp collisions with the TRK only
- run the simulation with pp collisions with the full ALICE3 detector
- explore the geometry of the detector and draw it via jsroot
- check out the data format
- run a simulation with PbPb collisions in another path
