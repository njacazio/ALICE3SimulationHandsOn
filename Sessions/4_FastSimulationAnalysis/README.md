## Session 75 min

## Scope of the session
- Learn what the other utility tasks do for the on the fly simulation do (TOF, RICH, ClusterSize), integration with hyperloop 15 min
- Use case 1: reconstruct of the invariant mass of the D meson 30 min
- Implementation of the PID in D0 reconstruction 10 min
- Extension of the PID preselection with the PID 10 min
- Use case 2: use of the TOF PID in an analysis with multiple detector configurations for primary tracks for e.g. dileptons 10 min

## At the end:
- At the end the analyser should be able to run a full analysis and extract a physics perforamnce statement on the detector configuration used as input

## Assignment
- setup your hyperloop analysis with a large jira ticket
- expand your workflow to include PID
- Reconstruct D0 invariant masses
- Improve signal extraction with PID
- Perform an analysis of multiple detector in a single go
