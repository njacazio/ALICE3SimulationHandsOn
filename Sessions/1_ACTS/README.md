## Scope of the session
- Learn how to run ACTS with the ALICE configuration
- Learn how to convert the output of the ACTS simulation to the AO2D

## At the end:
- You will be able to run your own simulation of the ALICE3 detector with ACTS
- You will be able to convert the output of the ACTS simulation to AO2D and process it for analysis

## Assignment:
1. run the simulation with ACTS in the `full_chain` directory with Geant4
2. change the gun injection to use pythia, try PbPb events
3. verify output produced by the ACTS and perform some simple QA with the macro in `simple_performance`
4. convert the ACTS output to an AO2D with the tools in `conversion_to_ao2d`
5. perform some AO2D analysis on the converted data
