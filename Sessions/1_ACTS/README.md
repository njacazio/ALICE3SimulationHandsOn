## Scope of the session
- Learn how to run ACTS with the ALICE configuration
- Learn how to convert the output of the ACTS simulation to the AO2D

## At the end:
- You will be able to run your own simulation of the ALICE3 detector with ACTS
- You will be able to convert the output of the ACTS simulation to AO2D and process it for analysis
